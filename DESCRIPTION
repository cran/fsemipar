Description: Routines for estimation or simultaneous estimation and variable selection of several functional semiparametric models with scalar response, such as the functional single-index model, the semi-functional partial linear model or the semi-functional partial linear single-index model. In addition, it includes algorithms for dealing with scalar covariates with linear effect coming from the discretization of a curve in the cases of the linear model, the multi-functional partial linear model and the multi-functional partial linear single-index model.
