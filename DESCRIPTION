Description: Routines for the estimation or simultaneous estimation and variable selection in several functional semiparametric models with scalar responses are provided. These models include the functional single-index model, the semi-functional partial linear model, and the semi-functional partial linear single-index model. Additionally, the package offers algorithms for handling scalar covariates with linear effects that originate from the discretization of a curve. This functionality is applicable in the context of the linear model, the multi-functional partial linear model, and the multi-functional partial linear single-index model.
